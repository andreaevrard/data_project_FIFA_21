# FIFA 21 PROJECT (I)

<br><br>

For this small project you are going to work in groups to put in practice some of the concepts of the previous week.

With your group mates, open the file in `file_for_project/fifa21_training.csv`. The objective is to create the best linear model to predict the column `OVA`.

You can find some documentation about the meaning of each column in the following links:

### 1

Each member of the team should have his/her own _juypter_ notebook. In addition, each group should have a `group jupyter notebook`.

### 2

Decide which columns can be predictive and which ones can be directly dropped and take the needed actions.

### 3

Decide among the members of the group who is going to take care of inspecting the remaining columns
of the dataset. For example:
Member 1: cols 1 -> 5
Member 2: cols 6 -> 10
...
and so on

### 4

Each member must do:

- Explore their assigned columns and write python code to perform any cleanup operation that the assigned columns may need.
- Perform any scaling operation that the assigned column may need.

### 5

Put all the code of each member into the `group jupyter notebook`.
