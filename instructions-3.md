# FIFA 21 PROJECT (III)

Now you will work only in the `group jupyter notebook`.

It is s time to train a linear model and save it. Please take a look to the following [resource](https://machinelearningmastery.com/save-load-machine-learning-models-python-scikit-learn/) to know how to do it.

In addition you will need to create functions to make predictions with your group model and to evaluate the model's results on your `group jupyter notebook`.

Later, the LT will pick your `group jupyter notebook`, it will load another dataset and it will apply/call your functions to clean the dataset, make predictions with your model and then evaluate your group model into the new unseen data.
