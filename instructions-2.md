# FIFA 21 PROJECT (II)

<br><br>

During this afternoon session, each member of the group must write a function which:

- takes a `dataframe` as input
- perform the data cleaning operations on the assigned columns
- return a new `cleaned dataframe`.

Then put all you group member functions into the `group jupyter notebook`.

### BONUS

Try to create a new function called `preprocess` which"

- takes a `dataframe`as input
- call all the other group member functions and apply them to the starting dataframe
- return a `clean dataframe`.
